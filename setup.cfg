# Descriptions of default ON error codes
# D201 - No blank lines allowed before function docstring
# D204 - 1 blank line required after class docstring
# D206 - Docstring should be indented with spaces, not tabs
# D207 - Docstring is under-indented
# D208 - Docstring is over-indented
# D209 - Multi-line docstring closing quotes should be on a separate line
# D210 - No whitespaces allowed surrounding docstring text
# D211 - No blank lines allowed before class docstring
# D300 - Use """triple double quotes"""
# D301 - Use r""" if any backslashes in a docstring
# D302 - Use u""" for Unicode docstrings
#
# Default OFF
# D202 - No blank lines allowed after function docstring (found 1)
#   - not convinced that this improves readability
# D203 - 1 blank line required before class docstring
