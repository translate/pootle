# D201 - No blank lines allowed before function docstring

# D210 - No whitespaces allowed surrounding docstring text
# D211 - No blank lines allowed before class docstring
# D300 - Use “”“triple double quotes”“”
# D301 - Use r”“” if any backslashes in a docstring
# D302 - Use u”“” for Unicode docstrings
#
# Default OFF
# D202 - No blank lines allowed after function docstring (found 1)
#   - not convinced that this improves readability

# .tox - exclude any tox installed files

# E129 visually indented line with same indent as next logical line
#   - No real agreement here.  Best to disable it for now
# E226 missing whitespace around arithmetic operator
#   - This makes split[a+1:b+1] look unreadble as split[a + 1:b + 1]
# E402 module level import not at top of file
#   - There are enough cases where we want to import in a function
# W503 line break before binary operator
#   - Jury is out on what is actualy more readable
# Default ignore list for ref E121,E123,E126,E226,E24,E704
