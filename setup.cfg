    ## * Clean:
    ##   - error - in our own code (don't regress)
    ##   - default - in other's code if they are not fixed.  Be specific about

    ##     others fixing their code, don't hide it)
    ##   - error - if we have no occurances in our's or other's code (keep it
    ##     clean - should essentially not be listed and falls to default error
