Supported Browsers
==================

Pootle targets the **latest stable** versions of major modern web browsers.

Pootle should not only work correctly, but it should also look great in
*Firefox, Chrome and Safari*.

*Internet Explorer* is an exception, where we support the latest two
stable versions (as of today, IE11+). Here Pootle should work well, but
might look imperfect.

Older browser versions might work properly too, but we are not committed
to ensure such support.

A nice to have goal is making Pootle usable in smaller screens such as
iPads. But this is not a hard requirement.

If you are about to use a feature which might not be available in the set
of supported browsers, check the `Can I Use... <http://caniuse.com/>`_
website first.
