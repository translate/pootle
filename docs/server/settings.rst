Settings
========

You will find all the Pootle-specific settings in this document.

If you have upgraded, you might want to compare your previous copy to the one
distributed with the Pootle version for any new settings you might be interested
in.


.. _settings#customizing:

Customizing Settings
--------------------

When starting Pootle with the ``pootle`` runner script, by default it will try
to load custom settings from the *~/.pootle/pootle.conf* file. These settings
will override the defaults set by Pootle.

An alternative location for the settings file can be specified by setting the
``-c </path/to/settings.conf/>`` flag when executing the runner. You can also
set the ``POOTLE_SETTINGS`` environment variable to specify the path to the
custom configuration file. The environment variable will take precedence over
the command-line flag.

If instead of an installation you deployed Pootle straight from the git
repository, you can either set the ``POOTLE_SETTINGS`` environment variable or
put a file under the *pootle/settings/* directory. Note that the files in this
directory are read in alphabetical order, and  **creating a 90-local.conf file
is recommended** (files ending in *-local.conf* will be ignored by git).

  (per server process).

Deprecated Settings
-------------------
