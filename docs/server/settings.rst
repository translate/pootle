Settings
========

You will find all the Pootle-specific settings in this document.

If you have upgraded, you might want to compare your previous copy to the one
distributed with the Pootle version for any new settings you might be interested
in.


.. _settings#customizing:

Customizing Settings
--------------------

When starting Pootle with the ``pootle`` runner script, by default it will try
to load custom settings from the *~/.pootle/pootle.conf* file. These settings
will override the defaults set by Pootle.

An alternative location for the settings file can be specified by setting the
``-c </path/to/settings.conf/>`` flag when executing the runner. You can also
set the ``POOTLE_SETTINGS`` environment variable to specify the path to the
custom configuration file. The environment variable will take precedence over
the command-line flag.

If instead of an installation you deployed Pootle straight from the git
repository, you can either set the ``POOTLE_SETTINGS`` environment variable or
put a file under the *pootle/settings/* directory. Note that the files in this
directory are read in alphabetical order, and  **creating a 90-local.conf file
is recommended** (files ending in *-local.conf* will be ignored by git).

  ``end`` points (datetime) as parameters.
  It must return an array of objects where every object has following
  properties:

  - `position`, specifying the point in the x-axis where the mark should be
    set (UNIX timestamp multiplied by 1000), and

  - `label` specifying the text that will be displayed next to the mark.

60-translation.conf
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Translation environment configuration settings.

.. setting:: AMAGAMA_URL

``AMAGAMA_URL``
  Default: ``https://amagama-live.translatehouse.org/api/v1/``

  URL to an amaGama Translation Memory server. The default service should work
  fine, but if you have a custom server set it here.

  This URL must point to the public API URL which returns JSON. Don't forget
  the trailing slash.


.. setting:: EXPORTED_DIRECTORY_MODE

``EXPORTED_DIRECTORY_MODE``
  Default: ``0755``

  On POSIX systems, exported directories will be assigned this permission. Use
  ``0755`` for publically-readable directories or ``0700`` if you want only the
  Pootle user to be able to read them.


.. setting:: EXPORTED_FILE_MODE

``EXPORTED_FILE_MODE``
  Default: ``0644``

  On POSIX systems, exported files will be assigned this permission. Use
  ``0644`` for publically-readable files or ``0600`` if you want only the
  Pootle user to be able to read them.


.. setting:: MT_BACKENDS

``MT_BACKENDS``
  Default: ``[]`` (empty list)

  This setting enables translation suggestions through several online services.

  The elements for the list are two-element tuples containing the name of the
  service and an optional API key.

  Available options are:

  ``APERTIUM``: Apertium service.
    For this service you need to set the API key. Get your key at
    http://api.apertium.org/register.jsp

  ``GOOGLE_TRANSLATE``: Google Translate service.
    For this service you need to set the API key. Note that Google Translate
    API is a paid service. See more at
    https://developers.google.com/translate/v2/pricing


.. setting:: PARSE_POOL_CULL_FREQUENCY

``PARSE_POOL_CULL_FREQUENCY``
  Default: ``4``

  When the pool fills up, 1/PARSE_POOL_CULL_FREQUENCY number of files will be
  removed from the pool.


.. setting:: PARSE_POOL_SIZE

``PARSE_POOL_SIZE``
  Default: ``40``

  To avoid rereading and reparsing translation files from disk on
  every request, Pootle keeps a pool of already parsed files in memory.

  Larger pools will offer better performance, but higher memory usage
  (per server process).


.. setting:: PODIRECTORY

``PODIRECTORY``
  Default: ``working_path('po')``

  The directory where the translation files are kept.


.. _settings#deprecated:

Deprecated Settings
-------------------

.. setting:: ENABLE_ALT_SRC

``ENABLE_ALT_SRC``
  Default: ``True``

  .. deprecated:: 2.5
     Alternate source languages are now on by default. This ensures
     that translators have access to as much useful information as possible
     when translating.

  Display alternate source languages in the translation interface.
