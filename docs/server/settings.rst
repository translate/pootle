Settings
========

Pootle's settings are spread in several *.conf* files within the
*pootle/settings/* directory. Files are split by category: project-level
settings, settings that control database backends, translation options, etc.

When customizing settings, **creating a 90-local.conf file is recommended**.
This way, in case you deploy Pootle by cloning the git repository, the
configuration file will be ignored by git. Moreover, all files ending in
*-local.conf* will be ignored, so it's a good way for keeping separate
configuration files for production, testing and development purposes.

The git repository provides a sample *90-local.conf.sample* configuration file
with the settings you are more likely to customize. You can find all the
Pootle-specific settings in this document.

.. note::

  Each file is read in alphabetical order, so in case you intend to add new
  configuration files or edit existing ones, take into account this behavior.



Available settings
------------------

This is a list of Pootle-specific settings grouped by the file they're
contained and ordered alphabetically.


10-base.conf
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This file contains base configuration settings.

^^^^^^^^^^^^

Site-specific settings.

  receive messages is controlled by :setting:`CONTACT_EMAIL`.


.. setting:: CAN_REGISTER

``CAN_REGISTER``
  Default: ``True``

  Controls whether user registrations are allowed or not. If set to ``False``,
  administrators will still be able to create new user accounts.


.. setting:: CONTACT_EMAIL

Configuration settings for applications used by Pootle.


.. setting:: CUSTOM_TEMPLATE_CONTEXT

``CUSTOM_TEMPLATE_CONTEXT``

  Custom template context dictionary. The values will be available in the
  templates as ``{{ custom.<key> }}``.


.. setting:: EMAIL_SEND_HTML

``EMAIL_SEND_HTML``
  Default: ``False``

  By default Pootle sends only text emails. If your organization would prefer
  to send mixed HTML/TEXT emails, set this to ``True``, and update
  *activation_email.txt* and *activation_email.html* in the
  *templates/registration/* directory.

  .. note::

    Password reset emails will still be sent in plain text. This is a limitation
    of the underlying system.


.. setting:: FUZZY_MATCH_MAX_LENGTH

``FUZZY_MATCH_MAX_LENGTH``
  Default: ``70``

  .. versionadded:: 2.5

  Maximum character length to consider when doing fuzzy matching. The default
  might not be enough for long texts. Please note this affects all fuzzy
  matching operations, so bear in mind this might affect performance.


.. setting:: MIN_AUTOTERMS

``MIN_AUTOTERMS``
  Default: ``60``

  When building the terminology, the minimum number of terms that will be
  automatically extracted.


.. setting:: MARKUP_FILTER

``MARKUP_FILTER``

  Two-tuple defining the markup filter to apply in certain textareas.

  - Accepted values for the first element are ``textile``, ``markdown``,
    ``restructuredtext`` and None

  - The second element should be a dictionary of keyword arguments that
    will be passed to the markup function

  Examples::

    MARKUP_FILTER = (None, {})

    MARKUP_FILTER = ('markdown', {'safe_mode': True})

    MARKUP_FILTER = ('restructuredtext', {'settings_overrides': {
                                             'report_level': 'quiet',
                                             }

.. setting:: USE_CAPTCHA

``USE_CAPTCHA``
  Default: ``True``

  Enable spam prevention through a captcha.


51-ldap.conf
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Optional LDAP configuration settings. To enable the LDAP authentication
backend, you'll need to append ``'pootle.auth.ldap_backend.LdapBackend'`` to
the list of ``AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS``.


.. setting:: AUTH_LDAP_ANON_DN

``AUTH_LDAP_ANON_DN``
  Default: ``''``

  Anonymous credentials: Distinguished Name.

  Default: ``''``

  Base DN to search


.. setting:: AUTH_LDAP_FIELDS

``AUTH_LDAP_FIELDS``
  Default: ``{'dn': 'dn'}``

  A mapping of Pootle field names to LDAP fields.  The key is Pootle's name,
  the value should be your LDAP field name.  If you don't use the field or
  don't want to automatically retrieve these fields from LDAP comment them out.
  The only required field is ``dn``.


.. setting:: AUTH_LDAP_FILTER

``AUTH_LDAP_FILTER``
  Default: ``''``

  What are we filtering on? %s will be the username, for example ``'sn=%s'``,
  or ``'uid=%s'``.


.. setting:: AUTH_LDAP_SERVER

``AUTH_LDAP_SERVER``
  Default: ``''``

  The LDAP server. Format: ``protocol://hostname:port``


60-translation.conf
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Translation environment configuration settings.

.. setting:: AMAGAMA_URL

``AMAGAMA_URL``
  Default: ``http://amagama.locamotion.org/tmserver/``

  URL to an amaGama Translation Memory server. The default service should work
  fine, but if you have a custom server set it here.

  This URL must point to the public API URL which returns JSON. Don't forget
  the trailing slash.


.. setting:: AUTOSYNC

``AUTOSYNC``
  Default: ``False``

  Set this to ``True`` if you want translation files to be updated
  immediatly.

  .. note::

    This negatively affects performance and should be avoided unless another
    application needs direct access to the files.

  .. warning::

    This feature is not maintained anymore, use it at your own risk.


.. setting:: EXPORTED_DIRECTORY_MODE

``EXPORTED_DIRECTORY_MODE``
  Default: ``0755``

  On POSIX systems, exported directories will be assigned this permission. Use
  ``0755`` for publically-readable directories or ``0700`` if you want only the
  Pootle user to be able to read them.


.. setting:: EXPORTED_FILE_MODE

``EXPORTED_FILE_MODE``
  Default: ``0644``

  On POSIX systems, exported files will be assigned this permission. Use
  ``0644`` for publically-readable files or ``0600`` if you want only the
  Pootle user to be able to read them.


.. setting:: LIVE_TRANSLATION

``LIVE_TRANSLATION``
  Default: ``False``

  Live translation means that the project called *Pootle* is used to provide
  the localized versions of Pootle. Set this to ``True`` to enable live
  translation of Pootle's UI. This is a good way to learn how to use Pootle,
  but it has high impact on performance.


.. setting:: LOOKUP_BACKENDS

``LOOKUP_BACKENDS``
  Default: ``['wikipedia']`` (Wikipedia enabled)

  Enables backends for web-based lookups.

  Available options: ``wikipedia``.


.. setting:: MT_BACKENDS

``MT_BACKENDS``
  Default: ``[]`` (empty list)

  This setting enables translation suggestions through several online services.

  The elements for the list are two-element tuples containing the name of the
  service and an optional API key.

  Available options are:

  ``APERTIUM``: Apertium service.
    For this service you need to set the API key. Get your key at
    http://api.apertium.org/register.jsp

  ``GOOGLE_TRANSLATE``: Google Translate service.
    For this service you need to set the API key. Note that Google Translate
    API is a paid service. See more at
    https://developers.google.com/translate/v2/pricing 


.. setting:: PARSE_POOL_CULL_FREQUENCY

``PARSE_POOL_CULL_FREQUENCY``
  Default: ``4``

  When the pool fills up, 1/PARSE_POOL_CULL_FREQUENCY number of files will be
  removed from the pool.


.. setting:: PARSE_POOL_SIZE

``PARSE_POOL_SIZE``
  Default: ``40``

  To avoid rereading and reparsing translation files from disk on
  every request, Pootle keeps a pool of already parsed files in memory.

  Larger pools will offer better performance, but higher memory usage
  (per server process).


.. setting:: PODIRECTORY

``PODIRECTORY``
  Default: ``working_path('po')``

  The directory where the translation files are kept.


.. setting:: VCS_DIRECTORY

``VCS_DIRECTORY``
  Default: ``working_path('repos')``

  .. versionadded:: 2.5

  The directory where version control clones/checkouts are kept.

Deprecated settings
-------------------

.. setting:: ENABLE_ALT_SRC

``ENABLE_ALT_SRC``
  Defaut: ``True``

  .. deprecated:: 2.5
     Alternate source languages are now on by default. This ensures
     that translators have access to as much useful information as possible
     when translating.

  Display alternate source languages in the translation interface.
