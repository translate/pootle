.. _commands:

Management commands
===================

The management commands are administration commands provided by Django, Pootle
or any external Django app being used with Pootle. You will usually run these
commands by issuing ``pootle <command> [options]``.

For example, to get information about all available management commands, you
will run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pootle help

.. note::

  If you run Pootle from a repository checkout you can use the *manage.py* file
  found in the root of the repository.


.. _commands#running:

Running WSGI servers
--------------------

There are multiple ways to run Pootle, and some of them rely on running WSGI
servers that can be reverse proxied to a proper HTTP web server such as nginx
or lighttpd.

The Translate Toolkit offers a bundled CherryPy server but there are many more
options such as gunicorn, flup, paste, etc.


.. _commands#run_cherrypy:

run_cherrypy
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. versionadded:: 2.5

This command runs the CherryPy server bundled with the Translate Toolkit.

Available options:

``--host``
  The hostname to listen on.

  Default: ``127.0.0.1``.

``--port``
  The TCP port on which the server should listen for new connections.

  Default: ``8080``.

``--threads``
  The number of working threads to create.

  Default: ``1``.

``--name``
  The name of the worker process.

  Default: :func:`socket.gethostname`.

``--queue``
  Specifies the maximum number of queued connections. This is the the
  ``backlog`` argument to :func:`socket.listen`.

  Default: ``5``.

``--ssl_certificate``
  The filename of the server SSL certificate.

``--ssl_privatekey``
  The filename of the server's private key file.


.. _commands#managing_pootle_projects:

Managing Pootle projects
------------------------

These commands will go through all existing projects performing maintenance
tasks. The tasks are all available through the web interface but on a project
by project or file by file basis.

.. versionchanged:: 2.1.2

The commands target can be limited in a more flexible way using the ``--project``
``--language`` command line options. They can be repeated to indicate multiple
languages or projects. If you use both options together it will only match the
files that match both languages and projects selected.

For example, to *refresh_stats* for the tutorial project only, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pootle refresh_stats --project=tutorial

To only refresh a the Zulu and Basque language files within the tutorial
project, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pootle refresh_stats --project=tutorial --language=zu --language=eu


.. _commands#refresh_stats:

refresh_stats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This command will add a background job to go through all existing projects
making sure calculated data is up to date.

The ``refresh_stats`` job will flush existing caches and update the
statistics cache.

This command will go through all existing projects making sure statistics are
up to date.

.. note:: Disabled projects are processed.

It's necessary to run this command after installing or upgrading Pootle. Also
consider running this command when things might go out-of-sync: if you make
changes directly in the database, if the cache backend has been restarted, etc.

The time it takes to complete the whole process will vary depending on the
amount of units you have in the database. If a user hits a page that needs
to display stats but they haven't been calculated yet, a message will be
displayed indicating that the stats are on its way.

When the ``--calculate-checks`` option is set, quality checks will be
recalculated for all existing units in the database.

To only recalculate ``date_format`` quality checks, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pootle refresh_stats --calculate-checks --check=date_format

When the ``--calculate-wordcount`` option is set, the source wordcount
will be recalculated for all existing units in the database.


.. _commands#calculate_checks:

calculate_checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. versionadded:: 2.7

This command will add a background job to go through all units and to
recalculate quality checks.

.. note:: Disabled projects are processed.

The ``calculate_checks`` job will flush existing caches and update the
quality checks cache.

It's necessary to run this command after upgrading Pootle if new quality
checks are added.

The time it takes to complete the whole process will vary depending on the
amount of units you have in the database. If a user hits a page that needs
to display stats but they haven't been calculated yet, a message will be
displayed indicating that the stats are on its way.

To only recalculate the ``date_format`` quality checks, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pootle calculate_checks --check=date_format


.. _commands#refresh_scores:

refresh_scores
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This command will go through all users and recalculate user's score.

When the ``--reset`` option is set, all score log data is removed and
`zero` score is set for all users.


.. _commands#sync_stores:

sync_stores
^^^^^^^^^^^

This command will save all translations currently in the database to the file
system, thereby bringing the files under the :setting:`PODIRECTORY` directory
in sync with the Pootle database.

.. note:: For better performance Pootle only saves translations to disk on
  demand (before file downloads and major file-level operations like
  version control updates).

.. note:: Disabled projects are skipped.

You must run this command before taking backups or running scripts that modify
the translation files directly on the file system, otherwise you might miss out
on translations that are in the database but not yet saved to disk.

For every file being synced, the in-DB ``Store`` will be updated to
reflect the latest revision across the units in the file at the time of
syncing. This allows Pootle to make optimizations when syncing and
updating files, ignoring files that didn't change.

The default behavior of ``sync_stores`` can be altered by specifying some
parameters:

``--force``
  Synchronizes files even if nothing changed in the database.

``--overwrite``
  Copies all units from database stores regardless if they have been
  modified since the last sync or not. This operation will (over)write
  existing on-disk files.

``--skip-missing``
  Ignores files missing on disk, and no new files will be created.


.. _commands#update_stores:

update_stores
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This command is the opposite of :ref:`commands#sync_stores`. It will
update the strings in the database to reflect what is on disk, as Pootle
will not detect changes in the file system on its own.

.. note:: Disabled projects are skipped.

It also discovers new units, files and translation projects that were
added on disk:

- Projects that exist in the DB but ceased to exist on disk will
  be **disabled** (not deleted). If a project is recovered on disk it can be
  enabled via the admin UI only.

- Translation projects will be scanned for new files and
  directories. In-DB files and directories that no longer exist on disk
  will be **marked as obsolete**. Also any in-DB directory will be
  **marked as obsolete** if this directory is empty or contains empty
  directories only.

- In-DB stores will be updated with the contents of the on-disk files.
  New units will be **added** to the store, units that ceased to exist
  will be **marked as obsolete**. Translations that were updated on-disk
  will be reflected in the DB.

You must run this command after running scripts that modify translation files
directly on the file system.

``update_stores`` accepts several parameters:

``--force``
  Updates in-DB translations even if the on-disk file hasn't been changed
  since the last sync operation.

``--overwrite``
  Mirrors the on-disk contents of the file. If there have been changes in
  the database **since the last sync operation**, these will be
  overwritten.

.. warning:: If files on the file system are corrupt, translations might be
   deleted from the database. Handle with care!


.. _commands#list_languages:

list_languages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. versionadded:: 2.5

This command prints all the language codes on the server. This might be useful
for automation.


.. _commands#list_projects:

list_projects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. versionadded:: 2.5

This command prints all the project codes on the server. This might be useful
for automation.


.. _commands#revision:

revision
^^^^^^^^

This command prints the number of the latest revision.

The revision is a common system-wide counter for units, which is
incremented with every translation action made from the browser. Zero
length units that have been auto-translated also increment the unit
revision.

If for some external reason the revision counter was removed or got
corrupted, passing the ``--restore`` flag to the command will restore the
counter's value based on the revision data available on the relational DB
backend. You shouldn't have the need to ever run this, though.


.. _commands#changed_languages:

changed_languages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Lists a comma-separated list of language codes that changed since the last
sync operation.

When ``--after-revision`` is specified with a revision number as an
argument, it will print the language codes that changed since the
specified revision.


.. _commands#test_checks:

test_checks
^^^^^^^^^^^

Tests any given string pair or unit against all or certain checks from the
command line. This is useful for debugging and developing new checks.

String pairs can be specified by setting the values to be checked in the
``--source=<"source_text">`` and ``--target="<target_text>"`` command-line
arguments.

Alternatively, ``--unit=<unit_id>`` can be used to reference an existing
unit from the database.

By default, :ref:`commands#test_checks` tests all existing checks. When
``--check=<checkname>`` is set, only specific checks will be tested
against.


.. _commands#translation-memory:

Translation Memory
------------------

These commands allow you to setup and manage :doc:`Translation Memory
</features/translation_memory>`.

.. _commands#update_tmserver:

update_tmserver
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. versionadded:: 2.7

Updates the ``default`` server in :setting:`POOTLE_TM_SERVER`.  The command
reads translations from the current Pootle install and builds the TM resources
in the TM server.

By default the command will only add new translations to the server.  To
rebuild the server from scratch use :option:`--rebuild`, this will completely
remove the TM and rebuild it.  To ensure that the TM server remains available
when you rebuild you can add :option:`--overwrite`.

To see how many units will be loaded into the server use :option:`--dry-run`,
no actual data will be loaded.

.. _commands#vfolders:

Virtual Folders
---------------

These commands allow you to perform tasks with virtual folders from the command
line.


.. _commands#add_vfolders:

add_vfolders
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. versionadded:: 2.7.0

This command allows you to create :ref:`virtual folders <virtual_folders>` from
a JSON file. If the specified virtual folders already exist then they are
updated with the provided data, but only if the data differs.

Check the specs for the :ref:`JSON format <virtual_folders#json-format>` in
order to know how to craft a JSON file that fits your needs.

This command requires a mandatory filename argument.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pootle add_vfolders virtual_folders.json


.. _commands#manually_installing_pootle:

Manually Installing Pootle
--------------------------

These commands expose the database installation and upgrade process from the
command line.


.. _commands#migrate:

migrate
^^^^^^^

.. versionchanged:: 2.7


.. note::

  Since the addition of the :command:`setup` management command it is not
  necessary to directly run this command. Please refer to the :ref:`Upgrading
  <upgrading>` or :ref:`Installation <installation>` instructions to see how to
  run the :command:`setup` management command in those scenarios.


This is Django's :djadmin:`django:migrate` command, which syncs the state
of models with the DB and applies migrations for them.


.. _commands#initdb:

initdb
^^^^^^

This is Pootle's install process, it creates the default *admin* user, populates
the language table with several languages with their correct fields, initializes
several terminology projects, and creates the tutorial project.

``initdb`` can only be run after :ref:`commands#migrate`.

.. note:: ``initdb`` will not import translations into the database, so the
  first visit to Pootle after ``initdb`` will be very slow. **It is
  best to run** :ref:`commands#refresh_stats` **immediately after initdb**.


.. _commands#collectstatic:

collectstatic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Running the Django admin :djadmin:`django:collectstatic` command finds
and extracts static content such as images, CSS and JavaScript files used by 
the Pootle server, so that they can be served separately from a static
webserver.  Typically, this is run with the :option:`--clear`
:option:`--noinput` options, to flush any existing static data and use default
answers for the content finders.


.. _commands#assets:

assets
^^^^^^

Pootle uses the Django app `django-assets`_ interface of `webassets` to minify
and bundle CSS and JavaScript; this app has a management command that is used
to make these preparations using the command ``assets build``. This command is
usually executed after the :ref:`collectstatic <commands#collectstatic>` one.


.. _commands#webpack:

webpack
^^^^^^^

.. versionadded:: 2.7

The `webpack <http://webpack.github.io/>`_ tool is used under the hood to
bundle JavaScript scripts, and this management command is a convenient
wrapper that sets everything up ready for production and makes sure to
include any 3rd party customizations.

When the ``--dev`` flag is enabled, development builds will be created and
the process will start a watchdog to track any client-side scripts for
changes. Use this only when developing Pootle.


.. _commands#useful_django_commands:

Useful Django commands
----------------------


.. _commands#changepassword:

changepassword
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pootle changepassword <username>

This can be used to change the password of any user from the command line.


.. _commands#createsuperuser:

createsuperuser
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This creates a new admin user. It will prompt for username, password and email
address.


.. _commands#dbshell:

dbshell
^^^^^^^

This opens a database command prompt with the Pootle database already loaded.
It is useful if you know SQL.

.. warning:: Try not to break anything.


.. _commands#shell:

shell
^^^^^

This opens a Python shell with the Django and Pootle environment already
loaded. Useful if you know a bit of Python or the Django models syntax.


.. _commands#running_in_cron:

Running Commands in cron
------------------------

If you want to schedule certain actions on your Pootle server, using management
commands with cron might be a solution.

The management commands can perform certain batch commands which you might want
to have executed periodically without user intervention.

For the full details on how to configure cron, read your platform documentation
(for example ``man crontab``). Here is an example that runs the
:ref:`commands#refresh_stats` command daily at 02:00 AM::

    00 02 * * * www-data /var/www/sites/pootle/manage.py refresh_stats

Test your command with the parameters you want from the command line. Insert it
in the cron table, and ensure that it is executed as the correct user (the same
as your web server) like *www-data*, for example. The user executing the
command is specified in the sixth column. Cron might report errors through
local mail, but it might also be useful to look at the logs in
*/var/log/cron/*, for example.

If you are running Pootle from a virtualenv, or if you set any custom
``PYTHONPATH`` or similar, you might need to run your management command from a
bash script that creates the correct environment for your command to run from.
Call this script then from cron. It shouldn't be necessary to specify the
settings file for Pootle — it should automatically be detected.
