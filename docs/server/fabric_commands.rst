.. _fabric-commands:

Available Fabric commands
=========================

.. versionadded:: 2.5

   Starting in this release, Pootle includes Fabric deployment scripts.

The sample Fabric scripts provide several commands that you can use to easily
deploy your Pootle site.

.. note:: Most of the examples in this section will use the ``production``
   environment, but remember that other environments can be used as well.


.. _fabric-commands#bootstrap:

bootstrap
---------

This command:

- Creates the required directories, asking to remove them first if they already
  exist
- Creates a virtual environment (virtualenv) and activates it
- Clones the Pootle repository from GitHub
- Checks out the specified branch, using master if no branch is specified
- Installs the deployment requirements as listed in :file:`requirements/`,
  including the base requirements as well

.. note:: While running it may ask for the remote server ``root`` password,
   or more likely the ``sudo`` password, which is the standard password for the
   remote user configured in the environment.

.. note::
   .. versionchanged:: 2.5.1 Added support for bootstrapping from a given
      branch on Pootle repository.

Examples:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ fab production bootstrap  # Call that will use the default 'master' branch
    $ fab production:branch=stable/2.5.0 bootstrap  # Call which provides a branch


.. _fabric-commands#compile-translations:

  chosen environment

.. note:: While running it may ask for the remote server ``root`` password or
   the ``sudo`` password (standard password for the remote user configured in
   the environment) as well as the specified ``db_user`` and/or database root
   password.  See the :ref:`mysql_conf <fabric-commands#mysql-conf>` command
   for a way to eliminate the need for database password prompting.

.. note:: This command will try to create a database on MySQL, which will fail
   if MySQL is not installed or the settings don't provide configuration data
   for creating the database.

Examples:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ fab production create_db

mysql_conf
----------

.. versionadded:: 2.5.1

This command creates a :file:`.my.cnf` MySQL options file on the remote system
with the password(s) for database access stored in them (the passwords are
taken from the :file:`fabric.py` settings file).  Once you have done this, you
can un-comment the alternate ``db_password_opt`` and ``db_root_password_opt``
settings in :file:`fabric.py`, which will eliminate the need for password
prompting on all MySQL operations.

Examples:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ fab production mysql_conf


.. _fabric-commands#production:

production
----------

This command:

- Sets up the configuration for the ``production`` environment in Fabric
  settings

.. note:: This command is useless unless it is called before another command or
   commands.

.. note:: This command allows changing the settings. To do so just pass it any
   of its arguments when calling it.

   Note that some commands might require passing any or all of these arguments
   to this command in order to overwrite the default settings before calling
   those commands. For example the command :command:`stage_feature` requires
   passing :option:`branch`, :option:`repo` and :option:`feature`.

.. note::
   .. versionchanged:: 2.5.1 Added support for altering the settings based on
      the passed arguments.

Available arguments:

``branch``
  A specific branch to check out in the repository.

``repo``
  A repository URL to clone from.

  This allows to checkout from a fork repository (not necessarily on GitHub)
  and try new features developed on that repository. It must be an URL that the
  ``git clone`` command is able to clone.

``feature``
  Allows specifying if the deployment is for a feature-staging server. Such
  servers are used by Pootle developers in order to allow quick test of new
  features using a live Pootle server.

Examples:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ fab production bootstrap

In the previous example :command:`production` is called to set up the
environment for calling :command:`bootstrap` afterwards.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ fab production:branch=feature/extension-actions bootstrap

In the previous example :command:`production` is called to set up the
environment for calling :command:`bootstrap` afterwards.

The :option:`branch` argument overwrites the default branch in the settings,
which are then used for all the subsequent commands (just :command:`bootstrap`
in this example).

.. code-block:: bash

    $ fab production:branch=feature/extension-actions,repo=git://github.com/unho/pootle.git bootstrap

In the previous example :command:`production` is called to set up the
environment for calling :command:`bootstrap` afterwards.

The :option:`branch` and :option:`repo` arguments overwrite the default
settings, which are then used for all the subsequent commands (just
:command:`bootstrap` in this example).

.. code-block:: bash

    $ fab production:branch=feature/extension-actions,repo=git://github.com/unho/pootle.git,feature=yes stage_feature

This example is like the previous one, with the addition of the
:option:`feature` argument that triggers the altering of several settings. That
altering is necessary for working with feature-staging servers.


.. _fabric-commands#setup:

--------

.. versionadded:: 2.5.1

This command:

- Runs :ref:`syncdb --noinput <commands#syncdb>` to create the database schema
- Runs :ref:`initdb <commands#initdb>` to populate the standard schema objects
- Runs :ref:`migrate <commands#migrate>` to bring the database schema
  up to the latest version

Examples:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ fab production setup_db


.. _fabric-commands#stage-feature:

  the deployed Pootle
- Calls the :ref:`update_db <fabric-commands#update-db>` command
- Calls the :ref:`deploy_static <fabric-commands#deploy-static>` command
- Calls the :ref:`install_site <fabric-commands#install-site>` command

.. note:: While running it may ask for the remote server ``root`` password and
   the specified ``db_user`` password.

.. note:: This command is intended primarily for deploying ad-hoc Pootle
   servers for easing the test of feature branches during Pootle development.

.. warning:: This command might require changing the **source_db** field in the
   :file:`deploy/ENVIRONMENT/fabric.py` file. Note that the database specified
   on this field must exist.

.. warning:: This command requires using the ``staging`` environment passing to
   it the :option:`feature` argument, the desired branch and optionally a
   repository URL.

Examples:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ fab staging:branch=feature/extension-actions,feature=yes stage_feature

    $ fab staging:branch=feature/extension-actions,feature=yes unstage_feature


.. _fabric-commands#update-code:

update_code
-----------

This command:

- Updates the Pootle repository from GitHub
- Checks out the specified branch, using master if no branch is specified
- Updates the deployment requirements as listed in :file:`requirements/`,
  including the base requirements as well

.. note::
   .. versionchanged:: 2.5.1 Added support for updating code from a given branch
      on Pootle repository.
