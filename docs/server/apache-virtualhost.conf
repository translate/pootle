    # Domain for the Pootle server. Use 'localhost' for local deployments.
    #
    # If you want to deploy on example.com/your-pootle/ rather than in
    # my-pootle.example.com/ you will have to do the following changes to
    # this sample Apache configuration:
    #
    # - Change the ServerName directive to:
    #   ServerName example.com
    # - Change the WSGIScriptAlias directive to (note that /your-pootle must
    #   not end with a slash):
    #   WSGIScriptAlias /your-pootle /var/www/pootle/wsgi.py
    # - Change the Alias directive for 'assets' to include the '/your-pootle'.
    # - Include the following settings in your custom Pootle settings:
    #   STATIC_URL = '/your-pootle/assets/'
    #   FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME = '/your-pootle'
    # - If you have previously calculated the stats:
    #   - Restart the RQ workers.
    #   - Run refresh_stats to recalculate the stats data.
    ServerName my-pootle.example.com

    # Set the 'POOTLE_SETTINGS' environment variable pointing at your custom
    # Pootle settings file.
    #
    # If you don't know which settings to include in this file you can use
    # the file '90-local.conf.sample' as a starting point. This file can be
    # found at '/var/www/pootle/env/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pootle/settings/'.
    #
    # Another way to specify your custom settings is to comment this
    # directive and add a new '90-local.conf' file (by copying the file
    # '90-local.conf.sample' and changing the desired settings) in
    # '/var/www/pootle/env/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pootle/settings/'
    # (default location for a pip-installed Pootle, having Python 2.7).
    #
    # This might require enabling the 'env' module.
