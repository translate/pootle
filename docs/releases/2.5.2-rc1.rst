===================================
Welcome to the new Pootle 2.5.2-rc1
===================================

.. note:: Not released yet. *Planned release date late April 2014*.

For those who can't wait you might be interested to know what we've got planned
on our :ref:`roadmap <roadmap>`.

Changes in Requirements
=======================
- Django >= 1.5.5 < 1.6
- `Translate Toolkit <http://toolkit.translatehouse.org/download.html>`_ >=
  1.12.0-rc1
- Python >= 2.6

Major Changes
=============

These are by no means exhaustive, check the `git log
<https://github.com/translate/pootle/compare/stable%2F2.5.1...master>`_
for more details.

- The registration and authentication layer is now handled by django-allauth.
  This gives Pootle implicit support for OpenID, OAuth, OAuth2 and Persona
  sign-in support.
- Placeables are used to highlight parts of the source text and easily insert
  them into the translation.
- Local Translation Memory (TM) augments the already available `amaGama
  <http://amagama.translatehouse.org>`_ TM by delivering TM results from the
  projects hosted on the Pootle server.  Images stored in
  :setting:`PODIRECTORY` ``$project/.pootle/icon.png`` provide an icon to the
  TM result.
- The ``view`` permission is now project-centric, it can be set server-wide or
  for projects, but not for individual language-project combinations.
- Dropped code for several external apps from Pootle codebase. Also upgraded to
  newer versions of those apps.
- The contact form has been converted to an AJAX form.
- The report target for reporting string errors has been dropped in favor of a
  report email address. The report is now sent using an automatically
  pre-filled  contact form. If the project doesn't have a report email then the
  reports are sent to :setting:`POOTLE_REPORT_STRING_ERRORS_EMAIL`.
- Some changes in the API.
- New management command to assign permissions to a user.


...and lots of refactoring, upgrades of upstream code, cleanups to remove
Django 1.4 specifics, improved documentation and of course, loads of bugs were
fixed.
