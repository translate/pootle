===================================
Welcome to the new Pootle 2.5.0-rc1
===================================

*Released on 16 March 2013*

At Translate we're pretty proud of this baby. Many changes have gone into 2.5.0
which follows on from 2.1.6 released more then two years ago. So many changes
that it's quite hard to list them all.

Why so long? Well we had the `Egyptian revolution
<https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%23freealaa&tbm=isch>`_, a complete change
in UI, and a load of features we wanted you to enjoy.  It took much longer to
stabilise it for you to enjoy.

Pootle 2.5.0 has been in production with many users, so although it is a new
official release, we've had many people running their production server off
this code.  This includes `LibreOffice
<https://translations.documentfoundation.org/>`_, `Mozilla
<https://mozilla.locamotion.org/>`_ and `Evernote
<https://translate.evernote.com/>`_. So you are in good company.

Requirements
============
- Django 1.3 or 1.4
- `Translate Toolkit <http://toolkit.translatehouse.org/download.html>`_ >=
  1.10.0
- lxml (now a runtime requirement)

Changes
=======

These are by no means exhaustive, check the git log for more details

User Experience
---------------
We undertook a major UI rework – we now have a clean new translation interface,
and overview page.

In the editor:

- We follow a new approach when you edit translations, you will see a list of
  units that meet some criterion.
- Translation Memory is displayed for the current unit – results are from the
  `Amagama <http://amagama.translatehouse.org/>`_ server.
- Filters are easily accessible while you translate, so you can quickly change
  these within the translation interface.
- Context rows are provided in the translation interface when you are filtering
  and these can be hidden or expanded.
- A timeline is provided for a unit. This provides a history of the changes in
  translation text, state changes, translator and dates of changes.
- Gravatars give credit to translators and suggesters.

In the overview page:

- The overview page allows you to drill down into certain types of units
  matching a translation state or with an error.
- It is now easier to see what work needs attentions, as we highlight next
  actions for your project.
- With editable project and language descriptions you can supply description
  for projects. These are editable using Markdown, reStructured or HTML.
- News alerts can now be sent via email to project participants.
- The overview page provides an expanded checks page that highlights all
  failing checks.
- Checks are classified into categories so that more urgent ones are
  highlighted to translators


Version Control
---------------
- Update the whole project at once avoiding slow file by file updates
- A separate :setting:`VCS_DIRECTORY`
  for VCS checkout is where Pootle now does all VC related work -- this ensures
  that we can work well with DVCS like Git.
- Detect new and removed files after a VCS update
- Management commands for VCS actions [Stuart Prescott]
- Add new files to VCS after updating from templates

Commands
--------
- :djadmin:`list_languages`
- :djadmin:`list_projects`
- :djadmin:`latest_change_id`
- --modified-since flag for :djadmin:`update_stores`
  and :djadmin:`sync_stores`
- :djadmin:`commit_to_vcs`
- :djadmin:`update_from_vcs`

Infrastructure
--------------
- All documentation is now on `Read The Docs
  <http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/pootle/en/latest/>`_
- We have a `new website <http://pootle.translatehouse.org/>`_ for Pootle
- We're using Travis for `Continuous Integration
  <https://travis-ci.org/translate/pootle>`_
- All our `code <https://github.com/translate/pootle>`_ is now on Github

...and of course, loads of bugs where fixed
