===============================
Welcome to the new Pootle 2.5.1
===============================

*Released on 24 January 2014*

Yes, we did miss our :ref:`6 month release cycle <release-process_principles>`!
Many changes have gone into Pootle 2.5.1 which follows on from 2.5.0 released
in May.

Pootle 2.5.1 has been in production for a number of users, so although it is a
new official release, we've had many people running their production Pootle
server off this code.  This includes `Mozilla
<https://mozilla.locamotion.org/>`_ and `Evernote
<https://translate.evernote.com/>`_. So you are in good company.

For those who can't wait you might be interested to know what we've got planned
on our :ref:`roadmap <roadmap>` for Pootle 2.5.2.

Changes in Requirements
=======================
- Django >= 1.4.10 (note that Django 1.5 and 1.6 are not yet supported)
- `Translate Toolkit <http://toolkit.translatehouse.org/download.html>`_ >=
  1.11.0
- Python >= 2.6

Installation and Upgrade
========================
- :doc:`Installation </server/installation>`
- :doc:`Upgrade </server/upgrading>`

Major Changes
=============

These are by no means exhaustive, check the `git log
<https://github.com/translate/pootle/compare/stable%2F2.5.0...2.5.1-rc1>`_
for more details.

- Tags -- You can now tag and filter translation projects, making it easy to
  focus on a set of languages.
- Goals -- you can now group files within a project to ensure that translators
  focus on the most important tasks first.
- Extension Actions -- you can create custom actions using Python scripts.
  These are displayed with current actions and allow you to extend Pootle's
  functionality.
- API -- an initial Pootle API is in place (disabled by default).


Changes since 2.5.1-rc1
-----------------------
- Goals: more efficient cache flushing mechanism, sites with large projects
  took very long to submit new translations.
- LDAP: explicit import of ldap.filter
- Tags: restrict accepted taggit versions to those that will work with Pootle's
  use of tags.


Important server admin changes
------------------------------
- The minimum required Python version is now 2.6.x. While Django 1.4.x supports
  Python 2.5, it is no longer supported by the Python Foundation neither by
  several third party apps.
- The database schema upgrade procedure has been redefined:

  - The `updatedb
    <http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/pootle/en/stable-2.5.1/server/commands.html#updatedb>`_
    management command has been phased out in favor of South's own
    `migrate <https://south.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands.html#migrate>`_
    command.
  - Post schema upgrade actions have been moved to the `upgrade
    <http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/pootle/en/stable-2.5.1/server/commands.html#upgrade>`_
    command.
  - The automatic update has been removed.

- The `setup
  <http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/pootle/en/stable-2.5.1/server/commands.html#setup>`_
  management command was added to hide the complexities in the altering of the
  DB when installing or upgrading Pootle.
- Fabric deployment scripts have been improved to make deployment easier.
- Security fixes identified by a Mozilla security audit have been implemented.
- Optimisations of asset caching such as Expires headers have been enabled.
- LDAP authentication backend moved to
  ``pootle.core.auth.ldap_backend.LdapBackend`` and received various fixes.
- Static pages can now be used to track the acceptance of terms of use.
- The quality check for spell checking has been globally disabled. It wasn't
  properly advertised nor documented, and it didn't perform well enough to be
  considered useful.
- *css/custom/custom.css* is now served as part of the common bundle.


Visual Changes
--------------
- User contribution are displayed in the users profile page.
- Breadcrumbs now follow the way a translator would interact with Pootle and
  are unified across all views of the project.
- Global search allows you to search across all projects and all languages.
- Last activity messages show quickly what last change was made to the
  translations.
- The export view allows for easier proofreading by translators.
- Various RTL fixes.


...and lots of refactoring, upgrades of upstream code, cleanups to remove
Django 1.3 specifics, missing documentation and of course, loads of bugs were
fixed
