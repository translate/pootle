===================================
Welcome to the new Pootle 2.5.1-rc1
===================================

*Released on 1 December 2013*

We almost missed our :ref:`6 month release cycle <release-process_principles>`!
Many changes have gone into Pootle 2.5.1 which follows on from 2.5.0 released
in May.

Pootle 2.5.1 has been in production for a number of users, so although it is a
new official release, we've had many people running their production Pootle
server off this code.  This includes `Mozilla
<http://mozilla.locamotion.org/>`_ and `Evernote
<http://translate.evernote.com/pootle/>`_. So you are in good company.

For those who can't wait you might be interested to know what we've got planned
on our :ref:`roadmap <roadmap>` for Pootle 2.5.2.

Changes in Requirements
=======================
- Django >= 1.4.10
- `Translate Toolkit <http://toolkit.translatehouse.org/download.html>`_ >=
  1.11.0-rc1
- Python >= 2.6

Installation and Upgrade
========================
- `Installation
  <http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/pootle/en/latest/server/installation.html>`_
- `Upgrade
  <http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/pootle/en/latest/server/upgrading.html>`_

Major Changes
=============

These are by no means exhaustive, check the `git log
<https://github.com/translate/pootle/compare/stable%2F2.5.0...2.5.1-rc1>`_
for more details.

- :doc:`Tags </features/tags>` -- You can now tag and filter translation
  projects, making it easy to focus on a set of languages.
- :doc:`Goals </features/goals>` -- you can now group files within a project to
  ensure that translators focus on the most important tasks first.
- :doc:`Extension Actions </features/actions>` -- you can create custom actions
  using Python scripts. These are displayed with current actions and allow you
  to extend Pootle's functionality.
- :doc:`API </api/index>` -- an initial Pootle API is in place (disabled by
  default).


Important server admin changes
------------------------------
- Pootle now uses South to manage database upgrades.  A single command replaces
  the various command used previously and the automatic update has been
  removed.
- Fabric deployment scripts have been improved to make deployment easier.
- Security fixes identified by a Mozilla security audit have been implemented.
- Optimisations of asset caching such as Expires headers have been enabled.
- Various LDAP fixes.
- Static pages can now be used to track the acceptance of terms of use.


Visual Changes
--------------
- User contribution are displayed in the users profile page.
- Breadcrumbs now follow the way a translator would interact with Pootle and
  are unified across all vies of the project.
- Global search allows you to search across all projects and all languages.
- Last activity messages show quickly what last change was made to the
  translations.
- The export view allows for easier proofreading by translators.
- Various RTL fixes.


...and lots of refactoring, upgrades of upstream code, cleanups to remove
Django 1.3 specifics, missing documentation and of course, loads of bugs were
fixed
