Updating translations
---------------------
from po/

./intltool-update --pot
./intltool-update xy

Generating the .xml and .desktop files
--------------------------------------
from package /

./maketranslations

This will use the .po files and .xml.in and 
.desktop.in to create a .xml and .desktop file

Lite Versions
-------------
For languages with no upstream translations of certain packages we
include a 'lite' version. This contains only the strings needed
by Virtaal, nothing more.  Translating these will ensure that
the user has an end to end localised experience.

Do not translate these if upstream exists.  We'll package upstream
package translation rather then your lite versions if they exist. Ideally
you should get these light versions upstreamed.

Currently we translate lite versions for:
* GTK - http://l10n.gnome.org/module/gtk+ (scroll down to UI translations)
* gtkspell - http://translationproject.org/domain/gtkspell.html
