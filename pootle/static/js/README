Directory contents
-------------------
+ js/

  - admin.js :
    Code for tasks performed in the administration area.

    Also sorts select elements (both normal and multiple) where language names are
    involved. This is done in JavaScript because currently it's not possible
    to sort them within Django.
    To sort a new select element, add the end of the element id to the 'ids'
    array.

  - common.js :
    Common code that is included in every page. This includes:
    - Code to handle the page zoom feature.

  - editor.js :

  - sorttable.js :
    Sorts tables according to its values. Used in the homepage as well as on the
    languages and projects listings. It has some customisations to support
    zebra stripes once the sort is done (using jQuery). The icons used on the
    table headings are custom code too.
    We may want to use a table sorter purely written in jQuery, such as
    tablesorter (http://tablesorter.com/docs/).

      (arguably more useful) object.
