# These are additional strings that we need for a fully localised Pootle. They
# come from Django and other dependencies and are not included in our POT file
# otherwise. This file itself is not used for a running Pootle.

# Rationale:
# Pootle sometimes needs one or two strings from an upstream project.  We don't
# want to waste our localisers time translating the whole upstream project when
# we need only a few strings. In addition having them here makes it easy for
# the translator to easily correct linguistic issues.

# Notes:
# 1. Don't change any of these strings unless they changed in Django or the
#    applicable Django app.
# 2. The adding of extra comments to help translators is fine.
# 3. If we ever rely on large parts of text from an upstream app, rather
#    consider having translators work on the upstream translations.
