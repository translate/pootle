Pootle is a full featured online tool with several possible methods for
installation. This file gives a few brief instructions to get started, but more
complete documentation exists online at:

  http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/pootle/en/latest/server/index.html

Pootle depends on a few Python packages, and can optionally use several others
for an optimal feature set and performance. Although a minimal installation
might be enough for initial experimentation, this might not provide the best
security, features or performance.

For the impatients with a working Python 2 installation with pip and
virtualenv, this is a good start:

  $ mkvirtualenv pootleenv
  (pootleenv)$ pip install Pootle-......tar.gz
  (pootleenv)$ pootle init
  (pootleenv)$ pootle setup
  (pootleenv)$ pootle collectstatic --noinput
  (pootleenv)$ pootle assets build
  (pootleenv)$ pootle start

On your first visit, Pootle will calculate stats, which might take a while.
