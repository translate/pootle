    <h3 class="title" id="about">About Pootle</h3>

    <p>Pootle is a web portal that allows you to translate more easily. The
    name stands for <acronym title="Gettext Portable Object">PO</acronym>-based
    Online Translation / Localization Engine, but you may need to read <a class="external"
    href="http://www.thechestnut.com/flumps.htm">this</a>. Pootle is <acronym
    title="GNU General Public License">GPL</acronym> licensed Free Software, and
    you can download it and run your own copy if you like.</p>

    <p>You can also help participate in the development in many ways (you
    don&#039;t have to be able to program).</p>

    <p>The Pootle project itself is hosted at <a class="external"
    href="http://translate.sourceforge.net" class="urlextern"
    >http://translate.sourceforge.net</a>
    where you can find details about source code, mailing lists, etc.</p>

    <h3 class="title" id="registration">Registration</h3>

    <p>While everybody can view the files, only registered users can edit
    them and receive credit for their effort, so unless your server uses LDAP
    authentication, the first thing you should do in order to translate, is to
    register.</p>

    <p>You can register in the register page (accessible by clicking
    <dfn>Register</dfn> in the menubar) following two simple steps, providing you
    have a current e-mail address.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Fill in your desired user name, a valid e-mail account, and
        enter your password twice for verification. Then choose <dfn>Register</dfn>
        and an you will receive a message with an activation link in the e-mail address
        you have provided.</li>
        <li>When you receive the activation message by e-mail, just click
        on the activation link and your account will be activated.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="title" id="account">Login and user settings setup</h3>

    <p>Now that you are a registered user, you can login to Pootle by
    following the <dfn>Login</dfn> link on the top menubar and filling in your
    credentials.</p>

    <p>Once you have logged in, your account&#039;s dashboard will be
    shown, which includes links to your selected languages and projects.</p>

    <p>The first time you log in, no links will be shown since you
    haven&#039;t chosen any before. You can click on the link provided to change
    your settings and select your preferred languages and projects. You can set
    more settings within the same page as well.</p>

    <h3 class="title" id="browsing">Browsing the files tree</h3>

    <p>Now that your dashboard is set up, you can reach the desired files
    for translation directly through the links in it.</p>

    <p>Another way to find the file you wish to translate is through the
    main page.<br/>
    The main page displays two categories - Languages and Projects.
    Choosing a language will give you the list of projects available for
    translation into this language; choosing a project will give you the list of
    languages to which it can be translated.</p>

    <p>Once you have chosen both the project and the language, you&#039;ll
    be presented with the files and directories available for translation.</p>

    <h3 class="title" id="translation">Online translating with Pootle</h3>

    <p>If you click on a filename it will start showing all the entries on
    the file, independently whether the entries are translated or not. This is also
    known as <dfn>Translate All</dfn>.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, if the translation for a file is not complete, you
    can click on the summary text (eg, <dfn>27 words need attention</dfn>), which
    will give you through all the untranslated or fuzzy entries on the file. This
    mode is also named as <dfn>Quick Translate</dfn>.</p>

    <p>In both cases you&#039;ll be presented with a two-column table, with
    the strings to be translated on the left, and the current translation on the
    right.</p>

    <p>The current edited entry will appear as a text box with the options
    <dfn>Skip</dfn> and <dfn>Suggest</dfn> or <dfn>Submit</dfn> below it.
    Naturally you can enter text in the text box and submit it or skip to the next
    entry.</p>

    <p>You can also directly access any of the other entries presented by
    clicking on the numbers on the left-hand side.</p>

    <h3 class="title" id="aids">Other aids from Pootle</h3>

    <p>Pootle&#039;s editor also helps translators by displaying <a class="external"
    href="http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/pootle/terminology_matching"
    >terminology</a> related to the entry currently being edited.</p>

    <p>Another helpful feature is the <a class="external"
    href="http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/pootle/alternative_source_language"
    >alternative source language</a>, which displays how the current entry has been
    translated into other languages.  In order for this to work, you must select
    your desired alternative source languages in you account&#039;s settings.</p>

    <p>In addition to the above, you can also download the translation
    file, work offline with your favourite editor and upload the file. For
    multi-file projects, you can download a ZIP file with all the files for a
    directory and upload the ZIP file with the translated files.</p>
