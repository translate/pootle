Pootle Credits
==============

See the README file for an explanation of what Pootle is. See the ChangeLog (or
svn history) for more detailed credits.  These are people who have contributed 
documentation or code, but bug reports are also a valuable contribution!  Many 
people have contributed suggestions etc on the translate-pootle list and these 
are also appreciated.  Thank you for the many translators who translated the 
Pootle interface.  If you've been left out, let us know!
