How to contribute
=================

Reporting bugs
--------------

Write your bug report so that you ensure developers are fixing the bug rather
than spending time trying to understand your bug report.  If we can't see it or
replicate it, likely we can't fix it.

Checklist:

#. Bug description is clear yet concise.
#. Clear instructions to reliably replicate the issue.
#. Screenshots rather than descriptions of screens.
#. Full traceback if one occured.
#. Links to the issue.

Commits and pull requests
-------------------------

Keep the commit log as healthy as the code. It is one of the first places new
contributors will look at the project.

#. No more than one change per commit. There should be no changes in a commit
   which are unrelated to its message.
#. Every commit should pass all tests on its own.
#. Follow `these conventions <http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/>`_ when
   writing the commit message.

When filing a Pull Request, make sure it is rebased on top of most recent
master. If you need to modify it or amend it in some way, you should always
appropriately fixup the issues in git and force-push your changes to your fork.
